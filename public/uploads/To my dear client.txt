Hello, Mr Ledge Corps

I hope everything is going well with you and your family.

It seems a little late to you, but let me send you the project screenshots.

Let me first explain what happened for the last two days.
My skype account has been blocked out for some reason.
I had to make a new one. But I promise I was on your project for most of the days.

---Now about the project.---

This demo shows implementation of backend, admin panel and dashboard for your website.
Most of the functions have been implemented, except a few minor that will take no time to complete.

I created two users, one administrator and a user.
Of course you can change it as you want.
Two different users will use same login form, but eventually landing in different dashboards. I did this using laravel framework.
Let me now preview you the website on the following video file.

I hope you would like it. But it is not a final version.

Thanks.
